[YouTube: How to use / build](https://youtu.be/DiVczJ92sAU?si=NvqnDvXE_LW7EHW8)

A web based anime torrent streamer which can stream torrents in the browser and on the VLC media player as well.

Built it as a mini project to familiarize myself with video streaming using ExpressJS and handling of streams and APIs in a ReactJS based frontend webapp.
